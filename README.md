## Navigating Files

If you want to work on frontend, the stuff you're looking for is probbably in the src folder.

Because this is React, you'll find your HTML templates inside the .js files, for exaple, the landing page is in `pages/index.js`.  Navigate through src and familiarise yourself with the modular design of the site.

All CSS is done using SASS.  This means you must do all CSS editing useing the `scss` folder.  Inside this folder you will find scss files contained in folders corresponding to their respective .js files.

## Thanks
