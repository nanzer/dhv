                    <p><b>Delta</b>Hacks is McMaster's annual student hackathon. This time, <b>Delta</b>Hacks will be a 24-hour hackathon taking place from Jan 26-27th, 2019. We hope to inspire students to hack for positive changes that align with their passions - whether it's environment, health, inequality, education, etc. And hence the name “delta” - as “Δ” stands for change.</p>

                <AccordionItemBody>
                    <p>Nothing! Zero! The event is absolutely free for all participants. We will provide you with the venue, food, Wi-Fi, etc. You just need to show up.</p>

                <AccordionItemBody>
                    <p>If you haven't found a team prior to the event, you'll definitely find one at the team building event after Opening Ceremonies. Everyone accepted will also be invited to the <b>Delta</b>Hacks' Slack prior to the hackathon in order to discuss ideas.</p>

                <AccordionItemBody>
                    <p>The maximum number of people per team is 4 - but you can definitely form a team with fewer members than that.</p>

                <AccordionItemBody>
                    <p>You will definitely need your laptop, phone, their chargers, as well as a valid student or government ID. Feel free to also bring along a sleeping bag, and we recommend some comfortable clothes.</p>

                <AccordionItemBody>
                    <p>We will send buses based on the number of accepted applicants from a particular area! For people traveling from elsewhere, although we would love to have you, we won't be able to provide individual travel reimbursement.</p>

                </AccordionItemTitle>
                <AccordionItemBody>
                    <p>We strictly abide by <a href="https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf">MLH's Code of Conduct</a> and <a href="https://mlh.io/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, and all participants must agree to abide by it.

                </AccordionItemTitle>
                <AccordionItemBody>
                    <p>By default, all intellectual property created at <b>Delta</b>Hacks V belongs to the student team, and the team agrees that any member of the team has the right to continue to develop the ideas and software either individually or as a group. Corporate Challengers may require a different disposition of intellectual property, but only if they have prior approval in writing from <b>Delta</b>Hacks V for the agreement to which they are asking students to agree. Where there are commercial possibilities for any project, it is recommended that the parties involved agree in writing on the sharing of the financial returns.</p>

                </AccordionItemTitle>
                <AccordionItemBody>
                    <p>Demographic information has no bearing on your application. All applications are judged solely on merit. The information collected is purely for statistical purposes, and will be used by the DeltaHacks team to improve the hackathon in future years.</p>

                <AccordionItemBody>
                    <p>DeltaHacks itself is not changing the world. Our goal is to encourage thinking about meaningful issues and problem solving that will enable <i>you</i> to change the world.</p>
