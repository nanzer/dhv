                <h2>DeltaHacks V :: DEL-LITTY-HACKS CHALLENGES</h2>
                        <p> Hey hackers! We know you love hacking, but we also know sitting on your asses for hours at a time debugging can be mind-numbing. So we’ve come up with some challenges to get you up and about, discovering the campus and hopefully meeting more people! 
                       </p>
                      <p> We’ll have you guys taking pictures of things around McMaster (don’t worry, we won’t make you walk out in the cold too much!) and either sending them to us through Snapchat or posting them on your Instagram with a hashtag.

                       </p>

                       <p> To sweeten the deal, we’ve got prizes!!!! The first place winners on Snapchat and Instagram respectively will win a Google Home mini, and one more will go to a random winner, regardless of when you submitted. 
                       </p>

                   <p><b>DEADLINE:</b> The deadline for posting will be Sunday Jan 27th at 12pm. </p>
