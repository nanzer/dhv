                    <AccordionItemBody>
                        <p>Every year UWHH raises millions of dollars in order to invest in a wide range of social services across Hamilton & Halton. This is primarily done by investing over 153 programs across 82 agencies, or non-profit charitable partners. One of the key ways to raise money is through workplace campaigns. These involve building relationships with companies of all different sizes and providing a wide range of engagement and volunteers opportunities, or Days of Caring. Days of Caring are an important part of how we communicate the impact of donations. During campaign season, the logistics of managing these opportunities across hundreds of companies and dozens of managers (RDMs), can prove challenging. UWHH is looking for an app based solution that can help us coordinate the offering across multiple people, locations, and agencies. Details about what kind of information can be found below. We are also interested in gamifying the process as DOC opportunities are scarce and account managers (RDMS) put in request that can be hard to accommodate. Each manager believes their account to be the most important and we hope to introduce some limits and guidelines on who can request how many DOC opportunities and to begin building out a database that can help us track the impact of DOCS on donations. By introducing a point system based on criteria such as account size, specific departments, previous DOC usage, etc., we hope to create an internal marketplace for DOC that will allow RDM’s to choose, trade, and swap these opportunities and thus reduce the difficulty of allocating the resources in a constrained market. The impact of this would be substantial as understanding the impact of DOC can help UWHH become much more strategic about the use of this powerful experience and generate more donations and therefore impact the lives of more people.</p>

                            <li>Allows for youth to know programming in advance and for them to be involved in planning – provides maximum impact and ensures they get the most out of the program</li>
                            <li>Ease of access and communication allows more youth leadership</li>
                            <li>Provides accessible leadership development opportunities</li>
                            <li>Can be used by youth, parents, and program leaders</li>
                            <li>Provides a platform to interact and engage with parents as we supports kids with the resources (related to academics, nutrition, mental health, physical health, etc.)  to succeed in school and make plans for their future</li>
                            <li>Provides general info about available programs to all users as well as a second level sign-in so that youth and parents participating in a specific program can access their specific program area</li>
